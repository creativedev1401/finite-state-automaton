# Goal
The goal of this project is to implement a Finite State Automaton using State and Memento design patterns

# Description

A Finite State Automaton, or Finite State Machine is a machine that is made up of one or more states. Only one state can be active at a time, however, there are transitions between states that allows the machine to transition between different states to perform different functions.
